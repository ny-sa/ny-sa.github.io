This is my first entry onto a new slate:

I've never done a blog, much less shared on social media. 
I've never made a website for where a blog could be done on. 
I've always kept my thoughts inside, and was perfectly fine with that.

Here I am though, because being 'perfectly fine' with the current wasn't the attitude I desire going forward.

Let this blog be a repository of myself, and what's on my mind now is 'I want to get back into coding again'.

I have a background in computer science, but haven't done anything to show for in the last three years. 
I still don't fully know what's held me back all that time, but as I'm tired of waiting, I ought to *start with something*.

One thing to note: the first entries here will be my impressions to what already happened by the date of said entry. I should be able to get to writing about the present soon.

In any case, here's to another start of a journey. Cheers
