This is my first entry onto a new slate.

<br/>- - - - -<br/><br/>I've never done a blog, much less shared on social media. 

I've never made a website for where a blog could be done on. 

I've always kept my thoughts inside, feeling perfectly fine then.

Here I am though, because being 'perfectly fine' with the current wasn't the attitude I wanted to have going forward.

Let this blog be a repository of myself; what's on my mind now is: 

<br/>*How can I get into coding again?*<br/><br/>

While I do have a background in computer science, I haven't done anything to show for in the last three years. 
I still don't fully know what's held me back all that time, but as I'm tired of waiting, I ought to *start with something*.

One thing to note: the first several entries here will be on what already happened by the date of said entry. I should be able to get to writing about the present soon.

In any case, here's to another start of a journey. Cheers
